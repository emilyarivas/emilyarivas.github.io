I am taking a computer science course at CSUF, and I graduate in 2025.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

- Lab 6, Part 1

    One of my favorite labs for this course is Lab 6, part 1. In part 1, my team and I had to create a code regarding mad libbing a sandwich order. I enjoyed the line-writing process, as we had to write outputs that requested users to input their choice of protein, bread, and condiment. This lab helped me better understand the use of std::vector and std::string when writing lines of code. Overall, Lab 6, part 1  was a fun and informative lab for me.

- Lab 7

    My second favorite lab is Lab 7. This lab was short but challenging. The lab’s goal was to create a code that adhered to specific street parking rules. I liked writing a code that told users what times and days it is appropriate to park on certain streets. Though it was difficult to call functions in the two different codes, I learned how to write Boolean Functions and arithmetic operators. Generally speaking, Lab 7 was a tough yet insightful process that I valued. 

- Lab 9, Part 2

    My third favorite lab was Lab 9, part 2. Part 2 required my team and I to write a code that resembled a guessing game. I was enthusiastic to write an output that printed whether or not the user’s input was a correct guess. After completing this portion of the lab, I learned the correct usage of std::ofstream and the implementation of std::vector<std::string>.
